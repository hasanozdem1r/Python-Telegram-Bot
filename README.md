# Python-Telegram-Bot
This repository kind of basic telegram bot practice. You can send just three commands to test
You should download this libraries
pyown, telegram,
And then my code has three commands
/start initial command.
/option to learn inline button command
/weather to learn weather right now command.
After open code in your ide you shouldn't start via F5(run button) 
You should run from your console.
python main.py
Secondly note my API Key is temporary you should get account from Open Weather Map ApÄ±
Thanks
